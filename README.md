**Hi there!** 👋🏼

I'm [Phatthawipha Jeamburanakul](https://im.jamjann.dev), a software engineer based in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦\
<sub>I know it is quite hard to pronouce my name, so you can also call me **"JAN"**</sub>


Currently, I'm a freelance full-stack developer with over 10 years of diverse commercial experience and a demonstrated history of working in the startup and design industry. 👩🏻‍💻

Throughout my career, I've worked with businesses of all scales to initiate and contribute to successful projects, including consulting, designing, and developing websites, mobile applications, and internal systems that meet my customers' requirements and the end users' needs.

I'm a quick learner, eager to learn new technologies, and passionate about using my skills to create something new and valuable for society and the world. 🌎 I also love challenging myself by accomplishing things beyond my familiarity and outside my comfort zone.


🌱 **Outside of work**  🌱\
I'm interested in boosting my new skill set and doing some fun stuff.

Recently, I've been enjoyed and obsessed with hiking, volunteering, being a street photographer, running an online business, oh, and also being a part-time pet sitter caring for little fur babies as well. 🐶
